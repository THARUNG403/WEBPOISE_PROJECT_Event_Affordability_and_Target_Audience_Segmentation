# WEBPOISE_PROJECT_Event_Affordability_and_Target_Audience_Segmentation
comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding  event affordability and target audience segmentation for event organizers. Using a  synthetic dataset of 1,000 samples containing demographic, economic, and event  participation data, the project employed a multi-faceted methodology.

# Key Findings and Methodology: 
• Feature Engineering established 
the 
($\frac{\text{Income}}{\text{Ticket Price}}$). 
Affordability 
Index 
• K-Means Clustering identified four distinct customer segments, notably an 
Affluent/Price-Insensitive group (Cluster 2) with the highest average income 
($94,946) and 100% attendance, and a Budget-Stressed group (Cluster 3) 
facing high costs relative to income, resulting in the lowest attendance 
(77.4%). 
• Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) achieved an 
accuracy of up to 90.5%. 
• The analysis confirmed that the Affordability Index is the single Most 
Important Factor in predicting attendance. 
# Conclusion: 
The primary recommendation is to adopt segment-specific pricing and marketing 
strategies. This includes focusing low-priced events (e.g., Festivals, $20-$60) on Low 
Budget segments and utilizing premium/VIP packages for High Budget, price
insensitive customers. Strategic pricing should aim for an Income/Ticket_Price ratio 
above 200 to mitigate attendance risk.
